If you got a real mess and want to clean like the pros, then you’ve got to see this! Hi, Billy Mays here with Zorbeez, the most absorbent material I’ve ever used. It has the strength and the muscle to pick up and hold over 20 ounces of liquid. Look at this! Zorbeez attracts liquid like a magnet! It doesn’t matter if it’s coffee, soda, even red wine! Watch how this powerful vacuum action pulls and cleans the stain from out of the carpet – just that quick. The secret is in the X27 fiber technology, making Zorbeez over 27 times more absorbent than cotton! Forget towels that just drip. And, unlike sponges that smell, Zorbeez is odorfree and leaves a path of clean. Now, you could clean and dry and never leave anything behind! You’ll be amazed as just how much they absorb – and they’re machine washable. Dry your entire car, even your dog! Use any cleaner for streak-free windows. An average family uses up to two rolls of paper towels week. That’s cash in the trash. Save money and even help save the environment. You get two jumbo Zorbeez plus three extra large for only $14.99. But call right now and I’ll send you another five Zorbeez absolutely free! That’s 10 Zorbeez for only $14.99! And as a special bonus, we’ll also include our Micromen Microfiber Duster free. It’s great for blinds, plants, glass, and more – and attracts just like a magnet! That’s a $60-value all for only $14.99. And here’s the best part: We’ll send you a set of Zorbeez free whenever you need them for life. Just pay shipping and processing. But you got to call now.
